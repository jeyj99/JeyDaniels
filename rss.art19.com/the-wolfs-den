It was there where he befriended film producer Mike DeLuca who funded Ellin's first short film The Pitch, starring then unknown actor David Schwimmer. That short film got Ellin accepted to the American Film Institute, where he graduated from in 1994. 

Ellin reached the A-list of Hollywood deal-makers &amp; creators in 2004 with his beloved series – Entourage – which became a cultural phenomenon and industry touchstone. The HBO show ran for eight seasons and Ellin made an eight-figure pact with HBO to continue producing television.

During the show, he flashed his business savvy by striking deals with major brands – among them: Apple, Cadillac, Ferrari, Johnnie Walker, and Tequila Avión.

Ellin has been nominated for three Emmy Awards, four Writers Guild of America Awards, three PGA Awards and a BAFTA, and has won a BAFTA and a PGA award.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In this very special podcast, Jordan interviews none other than Agent Coleman, the very same man who busted him and sent him away to camp back in the day, as seen in the blockbuster feature film, The Wolf of Wall Street. Only Agent Coleman is no actor, and the stories he tells are real. These two former adversaries -- turned good friends – dive right in and discuss how the whole cat and mouse game between them actually went down, how JB avoided prosecution (for a while) and who some of the other players were. They then segue into everything from Hillary's emails, the existence of The Deep State, how Coleman was banned from the entire nation of Russia, James Comey, The Trump scandal, and much, much more.

In fact, some time back, in Florida, (where else?) &nbsp;Meet Kevin, in all his impish, hipster, pranksterism, actually dressed up like a Christmas Elf and hand-delivered two-hundred large poinsettia plants to Cardone's offices! </p><p>They weren't able to get much work done that day at GCHQ, as no one could find their desk, but damn if the place didn't look festive! </p><p>Cardone went so far as to sue MK at one point in their ongoing feud, but the suit was not met meekly by Meet, and he was able to get it dismissed! Hear how he did it, and a whole lot more, by tuning in to this high-energy, anything goes podcast! </p><p>PS Thanks for the edibles, MK. I personally ate my weight in chocolate-covered pineapple. It was tres delish! </p><p>Join thousands of other high-achieving professionals who have used the experience and wisdom of Jordan Belfort to take their careers, and their lives, to the next level: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2XluQJa" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2XluQJa</a> </p><p>Subscribe: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/wolfofwallst" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/wolfofwallst</a></p><p>LISTEN ON:</p><p>ITUNES: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.co%2F2lbYTSE" target="_blank">https://apple.co/2lbYTSE</a></p><p>SPOTIFY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fspoti.fi%2F2kGDosV" target="_blank">https://spoti.fi/2kGDosV</a></p><p>CASTBOX: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ngKUvr" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2ngKUvr</a></p><p>STITCHER: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kvasE6" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2kvasE6</a></p><p><br></p><p>Follow Me: </p><p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Fj4jSz" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2Fj4jSz</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Kr2bMO" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2Kr2bMO</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=t-I7JFDDX4vUiyrW_WyjGtTj6m18MTU2OTUyMDM1NEAxNTY5NDMzOTU0&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=FxiZrJUH46o&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Xub1j7" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2Xub1j7</a></p><p><br></p><p>PLASTIQ - Sign up for a new account at <a href="http://plastiq.com/WOLF" target="_blank">plastiq.com/WOLF</a> and send $50 in fee-free payments!

      <itunes:summary>World-renowned white rapper, Dirt Nasty -- AKA, actor, Simon Rex – has lived quite the Hollywood life.




He started out modeling for Calvin Klein and Versace, then worked as an MTV VJ before being cast in the immensely popular, Scary Movie film series.




His character of Eminem-style rapper, Dirt Nasty, has become a much-beloved cult favorite, and here Simon dishes on what it was like to play such a defining role.




Joining the fast-growing, “Back to Nature” movement, Simon recently purchased an RV which he uses to unplug, recharge, and travel to remote sites where he can recreate off-grid.




JB and SR get down to the nitty-gritty as they discuss such salacious modern subjects as the changing drug culture, women, dating, #metoo, partying, religion, and, of course, what it’s like to make new friends as you are being administered a champagne enema on the roof of an RV.




Whether you’re currently on-grid, off, or in between, this is one interview not to be missed.

      <itunes:summary>Chris ‘Drama’ Pfaff grew up with his feet glued to a skateboard in the heartland of Akron, OH, while his head dreamed of coming to California, the true skater’s Mecca.

He rode his board, and the success of his cousin Rob Dydek -- a pro skateboarder and TV star from Rob &amp; Big and Rob &amp; Big’s Fantasy Factory – all the way from Akron to L.A. and didn’t rest on his laurels when he got here.

Once ensconced in Los Angeles, Chris was able to capitalize on his contacts, and an old-fashioned work ethic, to fulfill his lifelong dream of starting his own clothing line – which became the extremely popular street-wear brand we know as Young &amp; Reckless.

Jordan and Drama discuss the mistakes they have made in business, and in life, and share what they’ve learned from them that has taken them to where they are today.

If you are someone who is looking to be successful in any aspect of life, you should pay close attention to this podcast and learn the secrets of two masters. “Don’t be a creature of circumstance, become a creator of circumstance,” the Wolf tells us.  Words to live by.</itunes:summary>

Cardone is a master marketing guru and renowned author who excels in real estate investing, hosting speaking conferences, and educating young investors. He gives us some of his background in sales, and discusses how he actually got started by selling fish, door to door.




Right from the opening bell, these two sales superstars can’t agree on anything, which makes for some highly entertaining, and very heated, debate.

      <title>MADHOUSE IN THE WOLF'S DEN</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In this week's outrageous installment, JB hosts Impresario, Jeff Beacher, founder and ringleader of Beacher's Madhouse. Known as a modern-day P.T. Barnum, Jeff made a name for himself hosting parties and putting on wildly popular live shows in the Vaudevillian tradition – harkening back to the pre-motion picture days of traveling side-show circuses.  These two old friends are no strangers to madness and mayhem, and they waste no time launching into a decidedly candid, sordid, and un-PC conversation that touches on such salacious topics as midgets seducing models with hypnotism, the challenges of engaging in obesely overweight sex, Miley Cyrus riding a dildo, Paris Hilton riding an Oompa-Loompa, pornography, the best ways to pick up chicks, Kim Kardashian's ass, Amazon Ashley, Kelly Osbourne, antics in the Stratton Oakmont boardroom, drugs, religion, how JB invented the internet, how Jeff invented fake news, more drugs, strippers, hookers, health, and hoverboards. In the short history of the podcast form, I'm not sure there has ever been one quite like this. Not for the faint of heart or easily offended, you will learn more than you ever wanted to learn and laugh more than you'll want to admit. Learn more about your ad choices.
